We are currently investigating how higher emotional clarity, which is defined as being consciously aware of one's emotional state, affects mental health related variables, such as neuroticism, depression, and subjective well-being. In particular, we explore the effect of discrete emotion regulation strategies in the relationship between emotional clarity and the mental health variables.
