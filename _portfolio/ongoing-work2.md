Conducting research using NLP to analyze emotions and thoughts reflected in languages during my Master's, I developed interest in how language itself shapes human mind. How the use of emotion concepts embedded in emotion words could affect human personality traits associated with emotional stability and psychological well-being?

We are currently investigating how higher emotional granularity, which is defined as having rich and diverse emotional vocabulary, affects neuroticism and subjective well-being. Emotional granularity in negative emotions, in particular, is reported to increase emotional regulation, which affects emotional stability and has various mental health consequences. Therefore, we investigated how the effect of emotional granularity is mediated by emotion regulation, and how does the effect differ by the valence of the emotional vocabularies.
