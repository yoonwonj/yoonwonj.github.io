I am a post-masters researcher, and an incoming Cognitive Science Ph.D. student at UC San Diego. 

After graduating from Seoul National University with Bachelor of Arts in Psychology (Summa Cum Laude, Departmental First-Class Distinction), I received a Master's degree in Psychology at [Human Factors Psychology lab](http://hfpsych.snu.ac.kr) directed by Dr. Sowon Hahn.

I am excited to join [Language and Cognition lab](https://langcoglab.ucsd.edu/) directed by Dr.Benjamin Bergen starting this fall!

My research interest is in the intersection of Cognitive Psychology, Affective Science, Computational Linguistics, and Human-Computer Interaction.

During my Master's, I investigated Koreans' social cognition and loneliness during COVID-19 using psychological analysis and natural language processing. Through this process, I realized how powerful language is as a window to the human mind, and became more interested in the relationship between language and human mind. 

I also engaged in projects designing technologies to aid human life and increase mental health. Through this experience, I developed my passion in extending and enhancing human mental capacities using large language models and communication technologies.

Currently, I am exploring how language shapes emotion acquisition & perception, and how large language models reveal the relationship between language and human cognitive abilities. I am also interested in how computers could augment human emotional experiences (-coming soon!)
