I am a Cognitive Science Ph.D. student at UC San Diego, advised by Dr. Benjamin Bergen ([Language and Cognition lab](https://langcoglab.ucsd.edu/)) I completed my B.A. in Psychology (Summa Cum Laude, Departmental First-Class Distinction) and M.A. in Cognitive Psychology (advised by Dr. Sowon Hahn) at Seoul National University.

My research focuses on the relationship between language and emotion, spanning individual to cultural contexts. I combine behavioral experiments with methods from computational linguistics to investigate how emotion concepts vary across languages and the downstream consequences of these differences.

Previously, I studied emotion and social cognition using NLP and also in the context of humanâ€“robot interaction. More recently, I have become interested in theoretical approach for understanding the "affective cognition" in language-based artificial agents, asking whether and in what sense such systems can be said to possess or simulate emotion.
