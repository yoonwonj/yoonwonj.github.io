I am a post-masters researcher, and an incoming Cognitive Science Ph.D. student at UC San Diego. 

After graduating from Seoul National University with Bachelor of Arts in Psychology (Summa Cum Laude, Departmental First-Class Distinction), I received a Master's degree in Psychology at [Human Factors Psychology lab](http://hfpsych.snu.ac.kr) directed by Dr. Sowon Hahn.

I am excited to join [Language and Cognition lab](https://langcoglab.ucsd.edu/) directed by Dr.Benjamin Bergen this fall!

------
My research interest is in the intersection of Cognitive Psychology, Affective Science, Computational Linguistics, and Human-Computer Interaction.
