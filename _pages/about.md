I am a 1st year Cognitive Science Ph.D. student at UC San Diego, advised by Dr. Benjamin Bergen ([Language and Cognition lab](https://langcoglab.ucsd.edu/))

I completed my B.A. in Psychology (Summa Cum Laude, Departmental First-Class Distinction) and M.A. in Cognitive Psychology (advised by Dr. Sowon Hahn) at Seoul National University.

My research interest is in the intersection of Cognitive Psychology, Affective Science, Computational Linguistics, and Human-Computer(Robot) Interaction.
