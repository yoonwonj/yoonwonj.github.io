I am a 1st year Cognitive Science Ph.D. student at UC San Diego, advised by Dr. Benjamin Bergen ([Language and Cognition lab](https://langcoglab.ucsd.edu/))

I completed my B.A. in Psychology (Summa Cum Laude, Departmental First-Class Distinction) and M.A. in Cognitive Psychology (advised by Dr. Sowon Hahn) at Seoul National University.

My primary research focus is in the relationship between language and emotion, spanning from individual to cultural contexts. I am also interested in leveraging LLM to design better emotion model for social robots.
