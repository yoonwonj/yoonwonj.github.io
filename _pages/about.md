I am a post-masters researcher, and an incoming Cognitive Science Ph.D. student at University of California San Diego. After graduating from Seoul National University with B.A. in Psychology (Summa Cum Laude, Departmental First-Class Distinction), I received Masterâ€™s degree in Psychology at [Human Factors Psychology lab](http://hfpsych.snu.ac.kr) directed by Dr. Sowon Hahn.

My research interest is in the intersection of Cognitive Psychology, Affective Science, Computational Linguistics, and Human-Computer Interaction.

More about my research
------
During my Master's, I investigated Koreans' social cognition and loneliness during COVID-19 using psychological analysis and natural language processing. Through this process, I realized how powerful language is as a window to the human mind. 

Currently, I am exploring how language interacts with emotion acquisition & perception, and how large language models reveal the relationship between language and human cognitive abilities. I am also interested in how computers could augment human emotional experiences.

More about my life
------
In my spare time, I reading novels, watch movies, and occasionally write reviews about them.

I also love listening to any music, but not hiphop... I sing and play keyboard in amateur bands.
