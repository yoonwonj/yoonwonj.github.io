Using the dataset from the previous project [Lee et al., 2021](publication/paper-title-number-1), we explored how perspective-taking levels of diary writers evaluated by the third party were associated with their psychological characteristics. For this, we had 30,000 diary entries annotated with discrete levels perspective-taking per sentence by the trained annotators. The perspective-taking levels ranged from 0 to 3: with level-0 absence of perspective taking, and from level-1 being merely mentioning others whatsoever to level-3 being trying to understand the intentions behind or possible reasons for othersâ€™ actions. Based on this annotated journal entries, we performed cluster analysis on self-reported questionnaire responses provided by the journal writers, and conducted ANOVA on the identified clusters. Results revealed that the high perspective-taking group exhibited higher agreeableness, higher self-reported empathy, and less unpleasant feelings than the low group. These results mirrored the previously documented links between self-reported perspective-taking abilities and psychological qualities.
