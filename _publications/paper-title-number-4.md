Using the dataset from the previous project [Lee et al., 2021](publication/paper-title-number-1), we explored how perspective-taking levels of diary writers evaluated by the third party were associated with their psychological characteristics. We had 30,000 diary entries annotated with discrete levels of perspective-taking per sentence by the trained annotators. The perspective-taking levels ranged from 0 to 3. level-0 represented the absence of perspective taking, and from level-1 to level-3 represented merely mentioning others to showing attempts to understand the intentions and possible reasons behind othersâ€™ actions. Based on this annotated journal entries, we performed cluster analysis on self-reported questionnaire responses provided by the journal writers, and conducted ANOVA on the identified clusters. Results revealed that the high perspective-taking group exhibited higher agreeableness, higher self-reported empathy, and less unpleasant feelings than the low group. These results mirrored the previously documented links between self-reported perspective-taking abilities and psychological qualities.
